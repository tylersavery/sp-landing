                <h3>Copyright Issues</h3>
                <p>Storyplace has adopted a policy toward copyright infringement on the Services in accordance with the <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act</a> (the &ldquo;DMCA&rdquo;). While our policy is based on the US law we apply this same policy globally to all jurisdictions in which our Services are available. If you&rsquo;d like to submit a claim of copyright infringement, please visit our page on <span className="text-underline">Reporting Copyright Infringement</span>. Storyplace reserves the right to remove content alleged to be infringing without prior notice, at our sole discretion, and without liability to you or anyone else. In appropriate circumstances, we will also terminate a user&rsquo;s account if the user is determined to be a repeat infringer.</p>
                <h3>Content Guidelines</h3>
                <p>At StoryPlace, we offer a diverse range of stories and do not censor or modify the content posted, with the goal of creating a safe, inclusive and comfortable space for everyone. That being said, if a story or user violates our code of conduct, their story will be removed and the user&rsquo;s account will be blocked from the app. At Storyplace, we embrace anonymity, promote kindness and enforce empathy. We ask that you separate listening from agreeing and help us create an inclusive and respectful space for everyone and their stories. We want to ensure that Storyplace users know what type of content they can discover as well as content they can or cannot post.</p>
                <h3>Storyplace Code of Conduct</h3>
                <p>By using the Storyplace Services you agree to the following code of conduct.&nbsp;</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Post your thoughts and feelings, not spam. Please do not use Storyplace to express any hate speech, threats, offensive comments, spam, advertising or irrelevant content.</li>
                    <li>Separate reading from agreeing. Not all people have the same opinions and that&rsquo;s OK. Respect the story as told. If you don&rsquo;t have anything good to say, don&rsquo;t say it.</li>
                    <li>Kindness is key! Treat all stories the way you would want yours to be treated. Keep in mind that sharing a story is an act of bravery.</li>
                    <li>Empathy is not always pretty. Keep in mind that life&rsquo;s biggest lessons often come from stories that are difficult to read. Appreciate different perspectives.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Stay informed! Familiarize yourself with our Code of Conduct, Content Guidelines, Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.</p>

                <h3>Copyright</h3>
                <p>StoryPlace encourages all storytellers to express themselves and their creativity freely through original and true stories. We do not allow any copyright infringement or pirated material on the platform and will remove any works that we discover to have been published illegally.</p>
                <p>While some users may not be aware of copyright law, we do our best to educate and inform our community. Please read below for more information about Copyright law:</p>
                <h3>How does Storyplace protect my story from being stolen?</h3>
                <p>The Storyplace platforms are designed with the intention of protecting Storytellers and their stories as much as possible. We have several measures in place to help Storyplace users feel safe and limit copyright infringement on our platforms:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Interactions between users on StoryPlace are managed with full transparency to both parties. The moment a user takes any action on a story, (opens it, reads it, downloads material, sends a message, etc.) that action is recorded and an activity record is kept on file and visible to both parties at all times.</li>
                    <li>By law, your work is automatically protected under Copyright Law as soon as you put it into a fixed format, such as writing it down. There are several additional copyright license tools that you can use to submit or register your work prior to posting on StoryPlace, and you can find them in our Copyrights article. Keep in mind that to get the most protection or sue if someone unlawfully infringes on your work, you need to register it in your country&rsquo;s copyright office.</li>
                    <li>We abide by the DMCA process, so if you believe your work has been copied improperly, you can submit a DMCA Takedown Request and we will respond as soon as possible.</li>
                    <li>The copy/paste functions are also disabled on StoryPlace, which prevents users from easily copying your work.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>What is considered copyright infringement?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Posting the copyrighted works of others without their legal consent</li>
                    <li>Posting on behalf of someone else and giving credit to them. This is still a violation of copyright and will be treated the same way. Consent is ALWAYS required from the person who owns the material or story.</li>
                    <li>Adaptations or slight alterations to a work, such as changing names, copying the events and writing them in your own words, or simply changing a point of view.</li>
                    <li>Using an image that you do not own. This includes making a cover with an image that you do not own the rights to (unless it is in the public domain).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>What does and doesn't copyright protect?</p>
                <p>Copyright only protects the physical representation of an idea, not the idea itself. Unfortunately, similar plots, story themes, and titles are not enough to constitute a copyright infringement. This is why there are many stories and movies that are very similar to each other.</p>
                <p>Unless there is substantial evidence of copyright infringement that can hold up in a court of law, website administrators will not be able to remove the story. If this is the case, we suggest you try to contact the other writer and respectfully try to resolve the issue in private. If you are unsure of whether a work infringes your copyright, we encourage you to seek professional/legal advice before submitting a notice.</p>
                <h3>How does StoryPlace deal with copyright infringement?</h3>
                <p>StoryPlace takes copyright infringement very seriously. Users are not permitted to post stories that are not original material or that they do not own unless they have legal permission from the owner and can provide evidence when requested. Any published works that are reported to us, or that we discover, are removed immediately. If the work is not published, we require the owner to submit a Copyright infringement report and we will remove infringing works as quickly as possible.</p>
                <p>How do I report copyright infringements on StoryPlace?</p>
                <p>Please submit a Copyright Infringement report by going to <a href="https://old.storyplace.com/en/copyright-claim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.storyplace.com/copyright-claim</a> or email us at support@storyplace.com</p>
                <p><strong>Copyright in your country</strong></p>
                <p>If you want to register your story with your country&rsquo;s copyright office, there are a lot of resources online to help you. You can search for your country&rsquo;s copyright office through WIPO&rsquo;s Directory of Intellectual Property Offices at <a href="http://www.wipo.int/directory/en/urls.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.wipo.int/directory/en/urls.jsp</a>.</p>
